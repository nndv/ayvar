# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Ayvar. Anyone who wants to join is more than welcome. ðŸ™Œ

Any contribution will do, even the smallest one. If you want to contribute, but you aren't sure what to do or where to start with, feel free to reach out to the owner of this repository through an issue, or hop on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ayvarjs/help) and join the conversation.

Good points to start could be improving the documentation, of filing a bug report.

## Style

* Ayvar is written in ES6.
* We use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to format code. If you don't have Prettier installed in your code editor, you can use `npm run format` before submitting a pull request.

## Bugs

* Before submitting a bug report, search the issues for similar tickets. Your issue may have already been discussed and resolved. Feel free to add a comment to an existing ticket, even if it's closed.
* Be as detailed as you can in your title and report, don't leave out important details, describe your setup and [include any relevant code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example) with your issue.
* Please use GitHub [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) when sharing code.

## Tests

* We use [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) to run tests.
* Feel free to create a new `test/*.test.js` file if none of the existing test files suits your test case.
